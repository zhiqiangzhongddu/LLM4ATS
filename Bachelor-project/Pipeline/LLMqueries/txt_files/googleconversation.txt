BalabanJ: Electron Distribution Descriptor
BertzCT: Tuple of two numbers. First number is correlated with complexity of bonds, second number is correlated with complexity of the distribution of heteroatoms.
Ipc: This returns the information content of the coefficients of the characteristic
polynomial of the adjacency matrix of a hydrogen-suppressed graph of a molecule.
Kappa 1: Hallkier Kappa values. Note that these are NOT broken.
Kappa 2: Hallkier Kappa values. Note that these are NOT broken.
Kappa 3: Hallkier Kappa values. Note that these are NOT broken.
Phi: Kier Phi value for

BalabanJ: Electron Distribution Descriptor
BertzCT: Tuple of two numbers. First number is correlated with complexity of bonds, second number is correlated with complexity of the distribution of heteroatoms.
Ipc: This returns the information content of the coefficients of the characteristic
polynomial of the adjacency matrix of a hydrogen-suppressed graph of a molecule.
Kappa 1: Hallkier Kappa values. Note that these are NOT broken.
Kappa 2: Hallkier Kappa values. Note that these are NOT broken.
Kappa 3: Hallkier Kappa values. Note that these are NOT broken.
Phi: Kier Phi value for
