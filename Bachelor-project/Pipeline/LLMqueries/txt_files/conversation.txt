Please carefully review this list
of descriptors and select an absolut maximum of 10 descriptors that you think are most likely to have a correlation with the solubility of a molecule. Focus on selecting the descriptors with the highest potential correlation to solubility
of a molecule.
Do not provide any explanations for your selections. Just list out the descriptors you have chosen.
Please format your output with the selected descriptors listed one per line inside <selected_descriptors> tags, like this:
